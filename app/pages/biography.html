        Cole Peters (b. 1985) is a multidisciplinary artist fascinated by matter, energy, space and time, and the ways in which these forces shape our universe, our environment, and our perception. With a focus on physicality and temporality, his work emerges in compositions that emphasize material properties and&nbsp;processes.

      Cole’s work in sound builds on the methodologies of musique concrète, field recording and reductive synthesis. His recorded works and performances examine texture, pressure and phenomenology as scaffolds in an evolving thematic framework drawing on the natural sciences and sensory&nbsp;experience.
