    These images are a selection from a multiyear documentary project focusing on protest, public demonstration, and the issues which catalyse these actions. The series followed issues relating to the interplay of human rights, racism, marginalized communities, austerity economics and the shift towards increasingly right-wing political agendas in the UK.
