The collective claims that government cuts to domestic violence services are blocking survivors’ bridges to safety. At the hands of austerity economics, many DV centres in the UK have had to close, leaving others overcrowded and scrambling for financial support. In 2015, this resulted in an average of 2 in 3 women being turned away from DV refuges. That statistic was worse for Black and Minority Ethnic women, who were turned away at an average rate of 4 in 5.",

The UFFC was initially formed in 1997 as a coalition of Black families and friends affected by deaths in state custody; it has since expanded to include members of other ethnicities who are affected by deaths in state custody.
